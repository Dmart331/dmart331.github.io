My highschool did not offer an automotive shop class but they did offer multiple design corses. I found that design was the perfect fix for my passion for problem solving as well as client service. While I was providing design work, I was also working on my friends cars as a hobby. From sophomore year of high school up until went to Nashville Software School, I was providing logo's and branding for companies as a free lance designer. All the while providing auto repair services on the side. After high school, I it was the best option to attend MTSU in order to earn a degree that would allow me to provide designs professionally. After three years of school, I realized that only doing design work wasn't enough to quinch my thirst for complex problem solving and left school to work full time at a German auto repair shop.  It was here I really started to use my problem solving skills. After three years at the shop, I recieved an offer that I couldn't refuse. A client told me about a bank that needed people to work directly with the client. I couldn't pass the oppertunity up and moved to the bank where I stayed until they were purchased by a bigger bank. The bigger bank was completely different and not as client focused as I would have liked. One of my clients found out I would not be making the move to the new bank and told me to check into Nashville Software School. After doing my research and the pre-work, I decided that coding was the perfect balance between design and complex problem solving that I have been looking for. Coming into the school as extremely intemedating. I thought I had a pretty good understanding of what to expect with JS but after day one I didn't know what to expect. We covered basic functions and JQuery</p>

          <h2>I BELIEVE IN GREAT IDEAS</h2>
          <p>An important role of a developer is to be able to communicate with the client. I love being able to talk to a client about their idea and try to make that come to life.</p>
          <p>Sometimes a client doesn't know what is possible or impossible, part of my job is finding a way to acheive the impossible. Everything is impossible until it gets accomplished. It all starts with an idea.</p>
